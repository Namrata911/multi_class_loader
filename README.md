- Replace "/path/to/version1.jar" and "/path/to/version2.jar" with the actual paths to your JAR files.
- Modify "com.example.ClassName" with the actual package and class name you want to load.
- The URLClassLoader is used to load classes from external JAR files.
- Use the loaded classes and instantiate objects as needed.
- Keep in mind that this approach can lead to classloading issues and conflicts. 
- In a real-world scenario, you may want to consider more advanced solutions like OSGi or modularization to handle dependencies and versions more efficiently.
